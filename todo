//remove malloc casts
//verify void * values are dereferenced when needed
//in static functions, replace node with struct node_t (ie remove typedef)
//add static keyword to functions between comment markers
//create a del function for node_t
//implement comparator
//rename cur to root where appropriate (see node internal functions)
//set ptr to NULL after free() if needed
improve handling of non-existent/redundant set values that are passed into fns
repeated code

//spacing and consistency with existing code

FOR ALL:
- NULL container causes crash
- empty container doesn't
make the above two consistnet
