first last -> floor ceil
for get() fns, return ptr to container elem or value of container elem?
for stack queue deque move include list to .h file
omap: upper and lower key fns
oset omap: fns and header file prototypes same order
pair type should have key and val sizes?
rename the get_count fns to size (also do for other containers)
for get-esque fns, return value, ptr or const ptr?

FOR ALL:
- NULL container causes crash
- empty container doesn't
make the above two consistnet
